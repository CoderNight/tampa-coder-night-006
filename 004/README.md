# Robots Vs. Lasers

Coder Night entry for May 2013. The problem: http://www.puzzlenode.com/puzzles/4-robots-vs-lasers

Attempting a C++ solution, because I've never really written anything in C++ before, so why not. Rather than looking for the most elegant or clever solution, I'm just trying to get a feel for how things are put together in a C++ program.

## Usage

The program reads the input from stdin and replies on stdout.

    make
    cat puzzle/input.txt | ./robots-vs-lasers > output.txt
